Runner class p1
Step1. The first step is to setup the Scanner in the runner class using import Scanner
Using the scanner, we will welcome the user using a print statement and ask the user for the coordinate points and store it in a String variable

Step2. In order to turn the string into an integer we will call String Methods such as indexOf and substring to remove the
paranthesis and commas.


Step3. Now that we have the indexes of the () and the comma, we will setup 4 variables 2 representing the x coordinates
and the other 2 representing the y coordinate. Once we extract the x and the y and turn them into integers
we will begin making the LinearEquation object
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LinearEquation object
Instance Variables:
1.  private int x1
 1a. The integer will store the first x value

2. private int y1
 2a. The integer will store the first y value

3. private int x2
 3a. This integer will store the second x value in the second coordinate point

4. private int y2
 4a. The integer will store the second y value

5. private String slopeInFraction
 5a. Will represent the slope in fraction

6. private double regularSlope
 6a. Will keep the double value of slope

 Methods:

1. public double slopeCalc(double x1, double x2, double x3, double x4)
 1a. Will be rounded stored in a variable called double m

2. public double YIntercept()
 2a. The result will be rounded and stored in a variable called double b

3. public double Distance(double x1, double x2, double y1, double y2)
 3a. The result will be rounded and will calculate the distance between the coordinate points


6. public String usersNewCoordinate(double x)
  6a. The method will use the x coordinate in the parameter and calculate the coordinate poitns using the linear equation.

Constructor:
  public LinearEquationCalc(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2)
  A. This constructor will take the x and y values of the coordinates as parameters and use them to create a y=mx+b equation
  B. m values that are decimals will be turned into fractions
  C. b values will remain as decimals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Runner class p2
Step4.  We will use multiple print statements to print the following:
    x and y coordinates of both coordinate points
    the linear equation
    the slope
    the y intercept
    the distance between the two points

Step5. Next, a print statement will ask the user for an x value. the method usersNewCoordinate will be used
to print out the coordinate
