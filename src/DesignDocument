1. The first step is to setup the Scanner in the runner class using import Scanner
Using the scanner, we will welcome the user using a print statement and ask the user for the coordinate points and store it in a String variable

2. In order to turn the string into an integer we will call a method from the LinearEquation class
to remove the paranthesis and commas called CoordinateExtracter.
          2A. The method would would first take the length of the
          coordinates and how many characters it contains. Next we will uses the String method
          to find the indexes of the parenthesis and the comma.

3. Now that we have the indexes of the () and the comma, we will setup 4 variables 2 representing the x coordinates
and the other 2 representing the y coordinate. Once we extract the x and the y and turn them into integers
we will begin making the LinearEquation object

4. First thing in the object will be the method calculating the slope called SlopeCalc
 4a. Will be rounded stored in a variable called m
 
5. Next we will make a method called YInterceptCalc that will use the input to calculate the y intercept
 5a. The result will be rounded and stored in a variable called b

 6. After creating these two methods we will create a constructor called LineEquation
  6A. This constructor will take b and m as parameters and use them to creae a y=mx+b equation
